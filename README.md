# Cucumber API Testing Demo

This project demonstrates API-level test automation using Cucumber (BDD)
in a Java/Maven setup.

The system under test is a lightweight dummy authentication API.
The focus is on test structure, readability, and behavior rather than
infrastructure or business logic.

This repository contains fictional example code created for demonstration
purposes only. It does not include proprietary or confidential information.
